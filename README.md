Program Requirements: 
By using OOP programming approaches with class implementation, design the 
executable C++ program to execute the insertion and deletion algorithm to 
simulate the studentâ€™s marks key in process. Use array as of your data structure 
type. 

Your program must be able to execute the following: 
1. User will determine how many marks to insert. 
2. Marks must be in floating point data. 
3. Once user key in all marks, 
i. Calculate and display 
a. Total marks 
b. Average marks 

ii. Prompt a menu for the following options; 
a. Insert new marks 
- User need to enter new mark one by one 
- New mark insertion only allow at the end of the array. 
- Maximum number of new marks insertion is limited to 3 times only. 
- Prompt the user once new insertion reaches its limit. 

b. Delete existing marks 
- User need to delete the existing marks one by one. 
- User need to select the mark to be deleted 
- The maximum number of deletion is until the array is empty 
- Prompt the user once deletion reaches its limit.

c. Exit the program. 
** Requirement 3.ii will repetitively prompt an option menu unless user 
choose to exit a program (Requirement 3.ii.c)
